## Summary
According to the analysis Pewlett Hackard can anticipate 90,398 roles that will need to be filled in the near future. There are plenty of employees nearing retirement to mentor employees born in 1965 who are interested in filling any of the empty roles. While there are enough mentors, there are only 1,549 employees born in 1965 and of those, 1,089 are already in senior positions, so they may only be interested in filling Manager or Technique Leader roles. A survey could be sent to these employees to determine interest in a mentorship program for those specific roles. 

A separate survey could be sent to Staff, Technique Leaders, Assistant Engineers, and Engineers born in 1965 to determine whom, if any, are interested in a mentorship program to prepare them for Senior level roles or managerial roles.

Due to the small number of employees born within 1965, Pewlett Hackard may want to consider optimizing talent within the company, so the analysis was extended to reach beyond birth year and consider all employees not of retirement age. Table 3 shows these results.

*Table 3*

| Title | Number of Employees |
| ----- | -----------------------------------|
| Senior Engineer | 68,330|
| Senior Staff | 64,589 |
| Engineer | 33,084 |
| Staff | 28,889 |
| Technique Leader | 10,653 |
| Assistant Engineer | 4,074 |
| Manager | 7 |

This still leaves Pewlett Hackard in the position of determining how to fill a large wave of open roles with viable candidates.

Looking at the number of employees in engineering and assistant engineering roles, as well as staff and senior staff roles, it may be worth the company's resources to implement an upskilling or re-skilling program. Many of the current staff or senior staff employees may be interested in learning the skills needed to be an engineer. The knowledge of business acumen and familiarity with clients and customers held by current staff could be invaluable to the engineering teams. While at the same time, an upskilling or re-skilling program may also offer motivation and engagement to engineering employees who may be interested in filling Technique Leader roles, managerial roles, or other business roles in the future.

As internal employees move within the company, their positions will also need to be filled. Pewlett Hackard may want to consider developing relationships with universities known for their business and engineering departments. The college or university and Pewlett Hackard can innovate together to create programs (i.e. internships, Bootcamps, online courses, etc) that can develop diverse, creative, ambitious, and innovative students who could then be ready to step into a job at Pewlett Hackard upon graduation or completion of a certificate program.
